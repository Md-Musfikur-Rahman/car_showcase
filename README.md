# Car Rental Website

## Introduction

Welcome to the Car Rental Website project!

This Next.js and TypeScript-powered car rental website aims to provide a seamless car rental experience with the motto, "Find, book, or rent a car -- quickly and easily!" The website offers a range of functionalities, including user registration, advanced car search based on brand, model, fuel type, and build year. During the development phase, we tackled challenges related to TypeScript, form validation, and user authentication.

## Key Features

- **User Registration:** Securely register user accounts and unlock personalized features.
- **Advanced Car Search:** Discover the ideal car by specifying brand, model, fuel type, or build year.
- **Effortless Booking:** A user-friendly booking process ensures a smooth rental experience.
- **Responsive Design:** The website seamlessly adapts to various devices and screen sizes.

## Development Challenges and Solutions

During our development journey, we faced several challenges:

1. **TypeScript Type Errors:** We achieved type safety and resolved type errors through rigorous code reviews and TypeScript best practices.
2. **Form Validation:** Robust form validation was implemented using libraries like Formik and Yup to enhance data accuracy and security.
3. **User Authentication:** We established a secure user authentication and authorization system using technologies like JWT tokens and bcrypt hashing.
